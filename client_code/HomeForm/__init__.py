# This is the Python code that makes this feedback form work.
# It's a Python class, with a method that runs when the user
# clicks the SUBMIT button.
#
# When the button is clicked, we send the contents of the
# text boxes to our Server Module. The Server Module records
# the feedback in the database, and sends an email to the
# app's owner (that's you!).
#
# To find the Server Module, look under "Server Code" on the
# left.
